# Multilevel and Mixed Models

## Structure
- Data has a hierarchical structure (e.g., students within schools, weeks within stores).
- Level 1: individual observations.
- Level 2: grouping units.

## Fixed vs Random Effects
- Fixed effects: parameters associated with the entire population (global effect).
- Random effects: parameters that vary across groups.

## Variance Components
- Models partition variance into within-group and between-group components.
