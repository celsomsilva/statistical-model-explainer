# Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

## Definition
GLMs extend linear regression by allowing different distributions for the response variable and introducing a link function.

## Components
1. Random Component: Distribution of Y (Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, etc.).
2. Systematic Component: Linear predictor (Xβ).
3. Link Function: Connects mean of Y to linear predictor.

## Example
Logistic regression is a GLM with:
- Distribution: Binomial
- Link: Logit
