# Goodness-of-Fit Metrics

## R² and Pseudo-R²
- R²: proportion of variance explained (linear regression).
- Pseudo-R²: approximate measures for GLM.

## Deviance
- Measures model fit relative to saturated model.
- Lower deviance = better fit.

## Likelihood Ratio Test
- Compares nested models.
- Significant result indicates more complex model fits better.
